Please analyze the file, extracting 'Request line', 'Remote Address', and 'User-Agent' for each request. Group the data by request and format it in JSON. Assign an 'id' key to each request, incrementing its value for each subsequent request. Each request should be treated independently, without comparisons to previous requests. Avoid statements such as 'is the same as the previous requests'. Conduct a detailed security-focused review for each 'Request line' (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and incorporate this review into each request's JSON, using 'review' as the key and the review content as the value. Code examples are not necessary for this task. The output should solely consist of JSON, without additional commentary.
